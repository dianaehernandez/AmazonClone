# 🚀 AMAZON APP ICON - FINAL SETUP

## ✅ CURRENT STATUS:
- ✅ App name changed to "Amazon"
- ✅ Amazon icon saved as `amazon_icon.webp`
- ✅ Configuration updated

## 📝 NEXT STEPS:

### 1. Convert WebP to PNG
The `flutter_launcher_icons` package works best with PNG format. You need to:

**Option A: Using Paint (Windows)**
1. Open `assets/icon/amazon_icon.webp` with Paint
2. Save As → PNG format
3. Name it `amazon_icon.png` (in the same folder)

**Option B: Using Online Converter**
1. Go to any webp-to-png converter online
2. Upload your `amazon_icon.webp`
3. Download as `amazon_icon.png`
4. Place in `assets/icon/amazon_icon.png`

### 2. Generate App Icons
Once you have `amazon_icon.png`, run:
```bash
flutter pub get
dart run flutter_launcher_icons
```

### 3. Build Your App
```bash
flutter clean
flutter build apk --debug
```

## 🎯 EXPECTED RESULT:
- **App Name**: "Amazon"
- **App Icon**: Your Amazon icon with orange background (#FF9900)
- **All Platforms**: Android, iOS, Web, Windows

## 📁 FOLDER STRUCTURE:
```
assets/icon/
├── amazon_icon.webp  (your current file)
├── amazon_icon.png   (needed for icon generation)
└── README.txt
```

## 🔍 VERIFICATION:
After running the commands, check:
- `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-*/launcher_icon.png` files exist
- App displays as "Amazon" with your icon
