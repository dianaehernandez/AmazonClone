# JSON Data Storage Implementation - UPDATED

## Overview
Your Amazon clone app now uses JSON files to persistently store data locally on the device. This ensures that user accounts, cart items, product reviews, and all user data are preserved between app sessions.

## ✅ FIXED ISSUES

### 1. Total Amount Fixed
- **Issue**: Cart total was showing ₱0.00
- **Solution**: Fixed cart item selection logic - items are now selected by default when added
- **Result**: Correct pricing now displays in cart and checkout

### 2. Checkboxes Added  
- **Feature**: Cart items now have checkboxes for selective purchasing
- **Implementation**: Individual item selection with "Select All" functionality
- **Integration**: Only selected items contribute to total amount

### 3. Functional Profile Management
- **Edit Profile**: Complete profile editing with form validation
- **Addresses**: Add, edit, and manage multiple delivery addresses  
- **Payment Methods**: Manage cards, bank accounts, and digital wallets
- **Data Persistence**: All changes saved to JSON automatically

## What's Stored in JSON

### 1. User Accounts (`users.json`)
```json
[
  {
    "id": "user_id",
    "name": "User Name", 
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "user_password",
    "phone": "+639xxxxxxxxx",
    "address": "Complete Address",
    "orders": [...],
    "createdAt": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
]
```

### 2. Shopping Cart (`cart.json`)
```json
[
  {
    "product": {
      "id": "product_id",
      "name": "Product Name",
      "price": 1299.99,
      "imageUrl": "..."
    },
    "quantity": 2,
    "isSelected": true
  }
]
```

### 3. Product Reviews (`reviews.json`)
```json
{
  "product_id": [
    {
      "id": "review_id",
      "userName": "Reviewer Name",
      "rating": 4.5,
      "comment": "Great product!",
      "date": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```
      "name": "Product Name",
      "price": 999.99,
      ...
    },
    "quantity": 2
  }
]
```

### Products JSON Structure
```json
[
  {
    "id": "product_id",
    "name": "Product Name",
    "description": "Product description",
    "price": 999.99,
    "reviews": [
      {
        "id": "review_id",
        "userName": "Reviewer Name",
        "rating": 5.0,
        "comment": "Great product!",
        "date": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

## Implementation Details

### DataService Class
- Handles all JSON file operations (read/write)
- Uses Flutter's `path_provider` package to access device storage
- Includes error handling for file operations
- Provides methods to clear all data

### Provider Updates
- **AuthProvider**: Loads existing users on startup, saves new registrations
- **CartProvider**: Loads cart on startup, saves changes automatically
- **ProductProvider**: Loads products with reviews, saves new reviews

### Automatic Persistence
- Data is automatically saved when:
  - New users register
  - Orders are placed
  - Cart items are modified
  - Reviews are added
  - User profiles are updated

## Benefits

1. **Persistent Storage**: Data survives app restarts and device reboots
2. **Offline Functionality**: Works without internet connection
3. **Fast Access**: JSON files provide quick read/write operations
4. **Structured Data**: Maintains proper relationships between users, orders, and products
5. **Scalable**: Easy to extend with additional data types

## Usage

The JSON storage is completely transparent to users. All existing app functionality works exactly the same, but now data persists automatically. Users will see:

- Their cart items remain after closing and reopening the app
- Login information is remembered (user can log back in with same credentials)
- Product reviews they've written are preserved
- Order history is maintained across sessions

## File Locations

JSON files are stored in the app's documents directory:
- Android: `/data/data/com.example.flutter_application_1/app_flutter/`
- iOS: `~/Documents/`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%/Documents/`

## Future Enhancements

The current implementation can be easily extended to:
- Add data encryption for sensitive information
- Implement data synchronization with cloud storage
- Add data compression for large datasets
- Include automated backup functionality
